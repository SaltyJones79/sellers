# Instructions  

  You are designing software for an online auction site “BidHere.com”. One of the modules in the system is responsible for keeping track of all sellers registered at the site. 

Create a Person class for a user of the system. Create person.h and person.cpp files for this class. The class should contain the following data of a person in the system:
* first name,
* last name,
* user ID, and
* email address.
These data should be accessible in its derived class. (Consider should the data be private, public, or protected?)

This class should contain:
* a default constructor,
* a value constructor that receives all of the data to be placed into the data members as its parameters,
* a copy constructor.

The class should also contain:
* “get” methods to allow the client to obtain information about a person.
  * getFirstName, getLastName, getID, getEmail 
* “set” methods to allow the client to assign information to a seller.
* setFirstName, setLastName, setID, setEmail, and optionally setAllInfo
* overloaded operators
* overloaded == method that returns true if two sellers have identical names and email address; otherwise it returns false.
* overloaded !=, <, and > operators (for > and < operators, comparisons are based on last names)
* An overloaded assignment = operator.
* Overloaded << and >> operators (consider should these be friend functions?)
* print() – a virtual function that displays on screen all the information of a person with appropriate messages
* read() – a virtual function that reads in the information of a Person from an input file stream
Consider which of these methods should be const method?

Use the Person class as the base class, create two derived classes Seller class and the PowerSeller class. The Seller class inherits from the Person Class, and the PowerSeller class inherits from the Seller class.  Person --> Seller --> PowerSeller	

Implement the Seller class as a derived class of Person class.  Create the seller.h and seller.cpp files for this class. The Seller class contains additional data members that hold a seller’s:
* average star rating received from the buyers,  and
* total number of items sold.  
These data should be accessible by its derived classes. (should these data be private, public, or protected?)

The following methods are included in the seller class:
* A default constructor and a copy constructor
* A constructor that receives all of the data for a seller.
(for the constructors, make sure to call the base class constructor as appropriate)
* Appropriate get and set functions for the new data in this class
* print() – overrides the base class print() to print the base class data and print all additional seller data with appropriate messages. Make sure to call the base class print to print the base class data.
* read() – overrides the base class read() to read the base class data and reads all additional seller data items, one data per line in the given order. Make sure to call the base class read to read in the base class data.

Here is an example data for a Seller
```
S				         <-- indicate a seller record
Joseph		       <-- first name
Edmondson        <-- last name
jed2k			       <-- user ID
jed2k@apple.com	 <-- email 
3.6				       <-- seller rating
1400			       <-- total number of items sold
```

Implement a PowerSeller class that is derived from the Seller class. Create the powerseller.h and powerseller.cpp files for this class. This derived class contains additional data members include:
* the seller’s own web site address (string),
* number of items sold in the current year.

Methods included in this derived class are:
* A default constructor and a copy constructor
* A value constructor that receives all data for a power seller
* Appropriate get and set functions for the new data
* print() – overrides the parent class print() method. This method should call the Seller class print method to display all the information from a Person class and the seller class, and also display the additional power seller data with appropriate messages. 
* read() – overrides the parent class read() method. This method should call the Seller class read method to read all the information for Person class and seller class, and also read in the information for the specific data for a Power Seller. The addition data: (1) the web site address, (2) the number of items sold in the current year, one per line, follow from the Person and Seller data.

Here is an example data for a Power seller
```
P						      <--stands for power seller record
Jack						  <--First name
Smith					    <--Last name
jsmith					  <-- user ID 
jack.smith@google.com  <-- email address
4.6						    <-- seller rating
1800					    <-- total number of items sold
https://www.bottledMusic.com  	<-- seller’s web site
900	 					    <-- number of items sold current year
```

The main program will implement a seller management system with the following pseudocode design:
```
1. Initialization Step: Build the database of all the sellers.

//Perform seller management:
2.	while (not done)

      Display menu
      Get user choice

      choice 1: Print information of all sellers
      choice 2: Check information of a particular seller
      choice 3: Add a seller to the list
      choice 4: Remove a seller from the list
      choice 5: quit 

    end while;
```
The initialization phase:
* initializes the boolean flag/variable done and read information of the sellers from a file seller.dat and add them into a list of sellers.  The file seller.dat will contain information concerning sellers.  The first line before every seller will contain a letter ‘S’ or ‘P’ meaning that a seller is to be read or a power seller is to be read.  If ‘S’ is read, then the information will appear for a seller as described above.  
* If ‘P” is read, then the data starts with all information as a regular seller, and then followed by the seller’s own web site address (string) and the number of items sold in the current year, one per line. 
* All the sellers (whether a regular seller or a power seller) are to be added into the same list
* A STL list should be used to store all the sellers.
  
In the loop that performs seller management:
At the beginning of each iteration of the loop, a menu is displayed to
1. allow the user to print all sellers,
2. check a seller’s record,
3. add a seller to the list of sellers,
4. remove a seller from the list, or
5. quit.
Write a function to display the menu.

Write a separate function for each of the following four choice tasks:
1. If the user selects the option to print all sellers, then all seller records should be printed. For each seller in the list, all information of that seller is to be displayed, and for a power seller in the list, all information of a power seller is to be displayed. Use dynamic binding to let the system determine whether the seller is just a seller or a power seller. After all the information is displayed, control should be returned to the seller management menu.

2. If the user selects the option to check a seller’s record, then the user should be prompted for the seller’s name.  If the seller is found, then all information pertaining to the seller should be displayed.  If the seller is not found, then an error message should be displayed.  Use dynamic binding to let the system determine whether the seller is just a seller or a power seller.

3. If the user selects the option to add a seller, then the user should be asked whether the seller is a power seller or not.  If not, then just read a seller’s information and add it to the list of sellers.  Otherwise, read a power seller’s information and add it to the list of sellers.  

4. If the user selects the option to delete a seller, then the user should be asked to enter the firstname and lastname of the seller (or power seller) to be removed. If the seller is found, he/she is removed from the list, otherwise, display an error message.
